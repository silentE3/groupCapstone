# Usage

There are three different functions that this application can perform:
1. Generation: This function generates test survey data
2. Grouping: This function performs grouping on survey data
3. Reporting: This function creates a report of the grouping results

Each of these functions are accessible from the CLI (Command Line Interface)

Starting the program will display general help for using the applicatoins, including the three commands for the three functions this applcation can perform,
along with a short description of what each command does.
Additionally, using any of these commands followed by --help will provide usage infromation for that command.

These are the commands and their usage:

## gen

gen [-f,--filename PATH_TO_OUTPUT_FILE] [-c,--count NUMBER_OF_RECORDS] 

The gen file generates random survey data. The gen command will output the generated survey data as a CSV file and takes two optional parameters. They are as follows:
1. **-f, --filename** : the output file name where the generated data will be stored. The default is dataset.csv
2. **-c, --count** : the number of records to generate. The default is 20

## group

group SURVEYFILE [-o,--outputfile PATH_TO_OUTPUT_FILE] [-c,--configfile PATH_TO_CONFIG_FILE] [--report|--no-report] [-r,--reportfile PATH_TO_REPORT_FILE][-a, --allstudentsfile PATH_TO_ROSTER_OF_ALL_STUDENTS]

The group command performs grouping on survey data. The survey data is expected to be in CSV format with the first record being a header for the column names.
The group command takes one required parameter and four optional parameters.
The group command should make sure that algorithm correctly determines availability based on time slots, and that students are assigned with at least 1-2 preferred students instead of as many as possible.
1. **surveyfile** : the first requried parameter after the group command should be the path to the survey data.
2. **-o, --outputfile** : the file where the grouping data will be stored. This will be a simple list of user IDs with auto-generated group IDs in CSV format. 
    The default is output.csv.
3. **-c, --configfile** : this is a JSON-formatted configuration file. The default name for this file is config.json with the file being in the same locaiton as the program.
    More details on the structure of the configuration file are included later in this README.
4. **--verify|--no-verify**: this option indicates if a verification report should be generated automatically for the grouping results. The default is no-verify
5. **-r, --reportfile** : this is the path for the output file for the report generated from the grouping results. Note that this option is ignored if the --verify option is 
    not used. If --verify is used and this option is not set, the file name will be report-{outputfile}.xlsx, where {outputfile} is the file name used for the grouping
    data. Also note that the file is of type xlsx, an Excel file, and will have multiple sheets.
6. **-a, --allstudentsfile** : this is the path for a CSV file whose first column contains a list of all of the student IDs in the class. If this option is provided, the "roster" file will be used to add students that did not fill out the survey. This ensures that all students in the class will be grouped. The student IDs in the file must be the same format as the student IDs in the survey file.

NOTE: Any student who does not indicate any availability in the survey will be assigned full availability for all time slots for the purpose of grouping. This also means any student added automaticaly from the list of all students (the allstudentsfile option) will also be assigned full availability for the purpose of grouping.
## report

report GROUPFILE SURVEYFILE  [-c,--configfile PATH_TO_CONFIG_FILE] [-r,--reportfile PATH_TO_REPORT_FILE]

The report command creates a report from the grouping results. The report command takes 2 additional optional paramters. Ensure that the **surveyfile** is the data used as
the source for the **groupfile** and that the same configuration file is used that was used when generating **groupfile**.
#Eventually, we will be able to generate the report without having to use that report command, and that the report file name is similar to the initial file.
#
1. **groupfile** : the second required parameter after the verify command. This should be the grouping CSV file generated by a group command (or manually edited) whose 
2. **surveyfile** : the first required parameter after the verify command. This should be the same file that was used to genereate the **groupfile**.
    source survey data was the **surveyfile** provided to the first paramter.
3. -c, --configfile : this should be the path to the configuration file used when creating the **groupfile**. Its default value is config.json
4. -r, --reportfile: this is the path for the output file for the report generated from the grouping results. Its default value is grouping_results_report.xlsx. Note that this is an Excel file and will contain multiple sheets

# Configuration File

The configuration file controls how the application operates and identifies the fields used to generate grouping and verification data. The configruation file should be in
JSON format. The following is the structure and explination of the configruation file:

```json
{
    /*string, name of the class the grouping is for*/

## CI Configuration

A Github action has been configured in this repository for managing the Continuous Integration flow after opening a PR. The action currently runs a couple of things against the source code and requires that they pass before merging pull requests:
- unit tests - pytest is used to run unit tests
- linter - pylint is our linter of choice
