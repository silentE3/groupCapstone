def score_groups(variables: models.GroupSetData) -> float:
    '''
    This function scores a group set (entire grouping solution) based on:
        - number of disliked pairings
        - number of groups without an overlapping time slot
        - number of preferred/liked pairings

    Additionally, the scores are computed relative to a few fixed values within the solution
     set. These are:
        - number of students
        - max number of groups possible
        - number of preferred student slots on the student survey

    The scoring equation used is as follows:
        T (s, d, p ) = C1 + C2 * s + C3 * d â€“ 0.1 * p
                s = number of groups without an overlapping time slot.
                d = number of disliked pairings.
                p = number of preferred/liked pairings

            C1, C2, C3 are considered constants for each solution set:
                C1 = (0.1 * N * P)
                C2 = C1 + 1
                C3 = C2 * G + C1 + 1

                Where,
                    N = the total number of students being grouped
                    P = number of preferred/liked student slots on the survey
                    G = max number of groups possible (based on the target group size +/- 1)

        NOTE: This equation guarantees the following about a solution (groupings), relative to
         other solutions within the solution set:
            - The solution with greater disliked pairings will always have the worse (higher) score
            - A solution with the same number of disliked pairings as another, but fewer groups
                with an overlapping time slot, will always have a worse (higher) score.
            - A solution with the same number of disliked pairings AND groups with an overlapping
                time slot as another, but more preferred pairings will always score better (lower).
