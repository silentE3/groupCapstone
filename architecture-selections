The agreed upon architectural design choices are as follows:

A single command line application that will perform both grouping and scoring functions
The application will accept command line arguments and will not request any input from the user while running
The application will read settings from a config file (other than what is specified at the command line)
The application will be programmed in Python
We will use the Click Python package to create the command line interface
We will use pyinstaller to package the tool for distribution and installation
