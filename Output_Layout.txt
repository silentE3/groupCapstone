For the output CSV file, the layout will consist of the following columns (in this order): Group ID, Team Member # (each in a different column), 
Disliked pairings, Overlapping Time Slots, and Number of prefered pairs.

For Group ID, the column will have the group number which will point to the topic assigned to the group.

For Team Members, each column will have the name/ASURITE ID of each member of the group.

For the Disliked pairings column, I would suggest having a list of pairings that have a dislike for a group member (if any) and put them on
one line separated by /. For each pairing, it will have the ASURITE ID/name of a team member + "dislikes " + ASURITE ID/name of a team member the first one dislikes.

For Overlapping Time Slots column, I would suggest having a list of time slots in which all members are available. Each entry in the list will have the day followed by the 
actual time slot. Each entry will be separated by /.

For number of prefered pairs column, the column will have the total number of prefered pairs made by the team members in the group. I would suggest having the total number of prefered pairs 
or having the total number and a list of the prefered pairs. For the list, it will have the total number of pairs followed by the pairs that look like this (ex: (A1 A4)).


For the Output Excel file, the layout will consist of the following columns (in this order): Group ID, Team Member # (each in a different column),
